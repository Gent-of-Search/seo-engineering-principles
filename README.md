# üêô SEO & Engineering Principles V1

The SEO & Engineering Pricinples have been inspired by the original 12 principles of the Agile manifesto. Although this document was published in 2001, the values and principles are still being used by leading product and engineering teams (Artsy, Skyscanner and Intercom) to influence how they work together.

The principles outlined below are not meant to be an exhaustive list but instead meant to inspire SEO teams who work with developers to create their own set of team principles. 

These set of shared beliefs need to be agreed by teams so that they are aligned on a structured way of working.
Any principles that are agreed need to be continuously updated and reviewed by the SEO and engineering team.

üö® Warning üö®

The principles below are not a quick way to solve all problems between development or product teams. Not all business team structures are not designed to work with these principles or concepts.

It‚Äôs important to get consent and agreement within your team to work towards a set of agreed principles. This doesn‚Äôt mean that you can‚Äôt try out these principles and see if they work in your day-to-day but keep in mind that the purpose of team principles is to be clear about how you work.

## The top priority is to solve user problems

The SEO and development teams focus on solving user problems, not just shipping deliverables. The SEO team ruthlessly prioritise tasks and projects to focus on changing user behaviour that drive business results.

## The best results come from small independent squads

The best results come from an independent team of specialists that form a squad to solve a specific problem. This squad is made up of experts who can solve a specific problem and are given the autonomy to make decisions. 

## Team must have a clear definition of success

A team or squad must have a clear definition of success from the project lead. This includes success for both tasks and at a project level. SEO teams can provide a clear vision to the team through clear documentation, conversation and using shared understanding.

## Teams must work closely together on a project

SEO and engineering teams must work frequently and consistently together through the lifecycle of a project. The best results come from SEO specialists working directly within technical teams and are able to guide the decisions around development of SEO projects.

## Effective communication comes from shared understanding

Effective communication comes from conversation. The SEO team can use online collaboration tools to help facilitate conversation around tasks or projects to help get the team on the same page. These conversations are then documented and shared with the team.

## Teams work in small batches

SEO and engineering teams work together to release small and frequent changes. The team must work together to break down large complex projects into smaller batches that solve user problems. These smaller releases can fit within the release cadence of the development team.

## Simplicity helps to prioritise work

In order to keep releases small, SEO teams must ruthlessly prioritise tasks and projects with a focus to provide clear strategy with a clear set of initiatives that drive business results. The goal of prioritisation is to maximise the amount of low-priority work not done.

## Continuous attention to SEO code quality helps to reduce rework

SEO and engineering teams need to work together to create automated or manual SEO QA tests to monitor SEO code quality. The goal is the reduce the amount of rework needed to fix SEO bugs in the code. SEO bugs can impact on the bottom line of the business and reduce the agility of the team.

## Feedback loops help to improve how teams work together

SEO and engineering teams need to regularly reflect and adjust how they work together. The SEO team also must share success and failure with the team to help them understand the value of their work.
These feedback loops help to improve how the team works together to solve user problems.
